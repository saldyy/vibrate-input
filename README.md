### Implementation of a vibrate input

When the text input field contains a string that is a valid integer, clicking the submit button should trigger an alert displaying that number. If the value entered is not a number or a valid integer, the input field's border should turn red and the field should vibrate three times. If the user continues to enter an invalid number (e.g., including letters) and presses the submit button again, the input field should vibrate again.
